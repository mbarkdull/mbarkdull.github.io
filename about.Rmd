### Megan Barkdull

I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetic basis and evolutionary consequences of complex traits in ants. In Winter 2024, I will receive my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. While there, I've worked in the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) to investigate patterns of molecular evolution associated with a variety of social traits in ants. 

In January 2025, I will begin as the Assistant Curator of Entomology at the [Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County](https://nhm.org).

### You?

Interested in appearing here? Please contact me if you are interested in being a postdoctoral associate or undergraduate working on an independent project. I am particularly interested in working with prospective postdoctoral research to craft fellowship proposals (e.g. for the [NSF PRFB](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb)).
