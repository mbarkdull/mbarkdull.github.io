I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetics underlying complex traits in ants. I started my graduate studies in August 2019, in the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. 


While completing my undergraduate degree at New College of Florida, I participated in conservation genetics studies of the federally-listed Dakota Skipper butterfly (Hesperia dacotae) and of the rare Florida Duskywing Skipper (Ephyriades brunnea) in the lab of [Dr. Emily Saarinen](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/emily-saarinen/). These projects used microsatellite markers to describe patterns of genetic drift, population isolation, and genetic diversity in each species. 


During the summer of 2017, I worked with [scientists](https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/mark-e.-siddall) at the American Museum of Natural History to determine which genes are most effective at identifying the vertebrate hosts of terrestrial bloodfeeding leeches, using DNA derived from the leech gut. I also examined the diversity of parasites harbored by the leeches in our dataset. I returned to the AMNH in spring of 2019 to assist with another leech project, this time using bloodmeal DNA to determine the origin of leeches smuggled into the Toronto International Airport. 


During my gap year, I took part in a number of research activities here at Cornell. Working with two researchers at the Lab of Ornithology, I analyzed birdsong recordings to understand how [vocal learning shapes evolution](https://marceloarayasalas.weebly.com/) and diversification, and how [complexity in female vs. male songs has evolved](https://femalebirdsong.org/). I also continued to build on my population genetics background as a post-baccalaureate intern in [Dr. Kelly Zamudio’s lab](https://zamudiolab.org/), assisting  lab members with data analyses and wet-lab work. 


When I’m not running PCRs in the lab, I enjoy hiking, nature photography, watercolor painting, and cooking. I am also interested in science communication, and am active on Twitter. See the Contact page for details.
