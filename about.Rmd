I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetic basis and evolutionary consequences of complex traits in ants. In August 2019, I joined the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I'm currently investigating patterns of molecular evolution associated with a variety of social traits in ants. 

I also have a longstanding love of natural history museums, which dates back to childhood visits to the Smithsonian and which was deepened by my REU experience working in the American Museum of Natural History. Here at Cornell, I'm fortunate to work with the Cornell University Insect Collection in a number of ways, ranging from specimen databasing to [exhibit curation](https://www.museumoftheearth.org/six-legged-science). I'm always interested in incorporating museum collections into my work. 

I would never have become a scientist without mentors who believed in me, and without exposure to a variety of evolutionary research. Now, mentorship and outreach are important components of my role as a graduate student. I have helped put together [museum exhibits](https://www.museumoftheearth.org/six-legged-science); write about [museums and biodiversity for general audiences](https://www.priweb.org/blog-post/insects-under-threat-the-role-of-natural-history-collections-in-biodiversity-conservation) and for [kids](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2023.1048608); mentor undergraduate researchers; and share my research through [panels](https://youtu.be/HZ0WdZk84wM) and [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S__qv9kKUlY).
