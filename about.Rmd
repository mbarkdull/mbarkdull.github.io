I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetics underlying complex traits in ants. In August 2019, I started my graduate studies in the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I'm currently investigating patterns of molecular evolution associated with different manifestations of phenotypic plasticity in ants. 

I also have a longstanding love of natural history museums, which dates back to childhood visits to the Smithsonian and which was deepened by my REU experience working in the American Museum of Natural History. Here at Cornell, I'm fortunate to contribute to the Cornell University Insect Collection's databasing efforts, focusing on digitizing label data for our collection of ants. I'm always interested in incorporating museum collections into my work. 

I would never have become a scientist without mentors who believed in me, and without exposure to the different kinds of research that can be done. Now, mentorship and outreach are important components of my role as a graduate student. I have helped put together [museum exhibits](https://www.museumoftheearth.org/six-legged-science); write about [museums and biodiversity for general audiences](https://www.priweb.org/blog-post/insects-under-threat-the-role-of-natural-history-collections-in-biodiversity-conservation); and share my research through [panels and talks](https://bit.ly/3s4jOGB).  

Outside of work, I also enjoy hiking, nature photography, [creating art](art.html), and cooking.
