## Entomology at NHMLAC

I have the privilege of working with my fellow Assistant Curator, [Dr. Rodrigo Monjaraz-Ruedas](https://rmonjaraz.github.io), our Collections Manager Giar-Ann Kung, and our staff to steward the Entomology collection at the NHMLAC. Our holdings include approximately six million pinned specimens; tens of thousands of specimens preserved in ethanol; and a growing frozen collection. The collection's strength lies in its holdings of specimens of ants, phorid flies, scarab beetles, moths from North and Central America, and arthropods from the LA region.

We welcome the use of our collections by external researchers, whether through collaborations with our team or through specimen loans. To see our loan policies, [click here](https://nhm.org/collections-use-and-loan-policies-entomology), and to request a loan, please fill out [the Google Form linked here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTgfHOMjedHdjCRvD5rpMi_qhVToTxpRXkyADMPROh5-AwiQ/viewform).
