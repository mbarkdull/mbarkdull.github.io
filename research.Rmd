## Research

### How does phenotypic plasticity impact molecular evolution?
Phenotypic plasticity, or the production of multiple phenotypes from a single genotype, is ubiquitous across the tree of life and may play an important role in generating biodiversity on Earth. Ants are a great system in which to study phenotypic plasticity: ant colonies are composed of individuals with very similar genomes who nevertheless look and behave in very different ways. I am currently using comparative genomics to explore how different manifestations of phenotypic plasticity are related to patterns of molecular evolution in 24 ant species. 

### How can we use invertebrate-ingested DNA to answer conservation questions?
During the summer of 2017, I worked with scientists at the American Museum of Natural History to determine which genes are most effective at identifying the vertebrate hosts of terrestrial bloodfeeding leeches, using DNA derived from the leech gut. I also examined the diversity of parasites harbored by the leeches in our dataset. For a PDF of the paper that came from this project, click [here](Siddall2019_IdeatingIDNA.pdf). 

I returned to the AMNH in spring of 2019 to assist with another leech project, this time using bloodmeal DNA to determine the origin of leeches smuggled into the Toronto International Airport. For a PDF of the paper that came from this project, click [here.](Williams2020_CaughtRedHandedIDNAPointsToWil.pdf)

If you'd like to see the presentation on these projects that I gave at the 2019 Cornell EEB Winter Symposium, [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbDIzi-b7nOzG2G7QPHbeaEBfXfC9GMWZradYekb4Tw/edit?usp=sharing). 

### How does population fragmentation impact butterfly population genetics?
While completing my undergraduate degree at New College of Florida, I participated in conservation genetics studies of the federally-listed Dakota Skipper butterfly (Hesperia dacotae) and of the rare Florida Duskywing Skipper (Ephyriades brunnea) in the lab of [Dr. Emily Saarinen](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/emily-saarinen/). These projects used microsatellite markers to describe patterns of genetic drift, population isolation, and genetic diversity in each species. 

### Other research experiences:
During my gap year, I took part in a number of research activities here at Cornell. Working with two researchers at the Lab of Ornithology, I analyzed birdsong recordings to understand how [vocal learning shapes evolution](https://marceloarayasalas.weebly.com/) and diversification, and how [complexity in female vs. male songs has evolved](https://femalebirdsong.org/). I also continued to build on my population genetics background as a post-baccalaureate intern in [Dr. Kelly Zamudioâ€™s lab](https://zamudiolab.org/), assisting  lab members with data analyses and wet-lab work.
